## Welcome! 👋

I'm **Fernando**, a physicist from Mexico. 

I write code to simulate key characteristics of mixed stars, with the help of numerical methods. Afterwards I clean and analyze the data. And finally, I show our findings with simple yet concise plots.

My main language is *Python*, although I've also coded in C and C++. I use a lot of Python tools such as *Pandas*, *Numpy*, *Scipy*, *Matplotlib* and *Scikit*.

I'm currently working on obtaining a Python developer certificate.

I'm looking for a Data Analyst position. You can check my skills on my pinned repositories.
